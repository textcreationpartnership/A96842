            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE VVONDER OF Wonders, BEING A true Relation of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful riſing again of one (in the Ship called the <hi>Dunbar</hi>) who had been buryed on ſhore above 5 dayes, and ſtood upright in his Grave, and cry'd out with a ſhrill Voice, calling to the Fleet ſeveral times.</head>
            <p>THis being one of the ſtrangeſt and moſt miraculous of all Wonders that hath happened in this our age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the matter of this much to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accident, I ſhall inſtance two or three of the like nature very pertinento the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> writes in the Wars of the Danes, what ſigns and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, what miſerable cryes of men, claſhing of Swords and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and neighing of horſes were heard, in ſo much that the ſame day that <hi>Caeſar</hi> fought his battel with <hi>Pompeus</hi> the cry of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170804:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 111 -->an Army, and the ſound of Trumpets were head at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> Divers men that were in the battel of <hi>Marathonia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Medians</hi> affirmed that they ſaw the ſoul of <hi>Theſeus</hi> armed before the hoſt of the Greeks as chief General and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, running and ſetting on the Barbarous <hi>Medians,</hi> whom the <hi>Atherians</hi> afterward for that cauſe only honoured as a God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hector</hi> after he was ſlain by the hand of <hi>Achilles,</hi> appeared and deſired him not to throw his Carcaſe to be devoured by Doggs, but rather to deliver his body to be buried. So <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> appearing in like manner after he was dead to <hi>Achilles,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, him to beſtow upon his body all Funerall ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch like viſions we read of in the Scripture; But let us take notice of the <hi>Athenians</hi> who preſaged that when <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades</hi> joyned in battel againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> hearing a terrible noiſe, and beholding certain Spirits before the battel, to have Victory over the <hi>Perſians,</hi> judging thoſe ſights and viſions to be the ſhadow of <hi>Pan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> before they were vanquiſhed in the battel of <hi>Leuctris,</hi> their Armour claſhed together, and made an exceeding great noyſe in the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſo that at that time the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> being faſt ſhut with Iron barrs, opened ſuddenly of their own accord, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which hung faſtened before on the wall, was found on the ground.</p>
            <p>But now to come to this ſtrange and much to be admired ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it ſelf, which was as followeth, <hi>viz:</hi> The Fleet being now ſafely arrived from the Sound into their deſired Harbours where they lye in ſafety, and the Souldiers being paid off, ſome who were in the ſhip called the <hi>Dunbar,</hi> do credibly report a ſtrange and wonderfull accident which happened to one in that ſhip, who after he was dead and buried on the ſhore above five dayes, he to their great amazement roſe again, and there ſtood upright in his Grave ſeverall dayes together about Noon-tide, and cryed out to the Fleet with a moſt ſhrill voyce, ſaying unto them, <hi>that they ſhould take up his Corps and bury him ſome where elſe further from the ſhore, otherwiſe he ſhould disturb
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170804:3"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 111 -->and molest all ſhipping that ſhould come up that Road:</hi> upon which his dolefull cryes, ſome of the Seamen of the <hi>Dunbar</hi> conſidering thereof; were commanded out and went on ſhore, (after he was vaniſhed again) and took up his Corps, and buried it again further in the Land, after which he was ſeen no more, to riſe or diſturb them in the leaſt with theſe diſmall exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the further ſatisfaction of the Incredulous, thoſe that will not put confidence hereto may enquire of any Seamen who were in that Veſſel, who will maintaine the truth thereof, and de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lare the particulars more exactly being eye-witneſſes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>One thing more above the reſt is alſo obſervable, That the party before he was buried came alſo from the Grave into the room he dy'd out of among the ſick men, a woman all in black walking before, and there told them by what token they ſhould know his Grave which was by the lying of a white Wond croſs the grave, the Seamen that went after his departure found the Wand according to this direction.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall give you an account of as ſtrange an appearance as the former, which was thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of the Ship called the <hi>Dunbar,</hi> being a ſhore in a Village where ſeveral ſick men of their Veſſel lay, and he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Window reading a Book, was ſuddenly conveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of the place, and being gone, ſeverall perſons miſſing him ſearched both Ditches and Wells, thinking he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away; but their long ſearch proved to little purpoſe, for they could never hear of him more; At the ſame time many were in the ſame room, but neither ſaw nor hear'd the leaſt noiſe or diſturbance at his departure, or how he went from thence, which ſeemed as miraculous to them as the former accident.</p>
            <p>Now to the ſtrange and wonderfull appearance in the Ayre, which happened in the North part of England, it being very true and apparent to the ſight of ſeverall ſpectators, I ſhall give you a brief account thereof, thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Septemb. 7. in the afternoon there was ſeen at Markfield in Leiceſterſhire extraordinary flaſhes of lightning, which breaking from the angry Clouds made way for the enſuing thunder, the claps whereof were terrible, and continued ch<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding and roaring in the Air for the ſpace of an hour: At every ſilence and reſpite of the Thunder, the lightning during this dreadfull ſtorm did break forth with great force: And the next voyce of the Thunder was louder, and more affrighting then that which was before; There were no ſhowres of raine, but at the laſt there was a moſt black and dreadfull ſtorm of Hail, and inſtead of Hail-ſtones there fell ratling down from the Air, Halberts, Swords, and Daggers, which being taken up were found to be of the ſame nature, and to be begotten of the ſame extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cold as were the Hailſtones, and after a little time, both the ſight and the fright which the ſight brought with it, did melt away at once.</p>
            <p>Many of the Town of Markfield, and places adjacent were much amazed at this prodigious ſpectacle, which to increaſe their wonder, was ſeconded by another terrible noiſe in the Air, as if two great Armies had been on their march, and ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vancing one againſt the other; The Canons were heard to play with importunate fury, and the Muskets on both ſides in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated volleys did diſcharge their cholerick errands: During this incounter there were beheld many prodigious eruptions of ſire, which with great violence did fly in the Air, and running lower, did tear in pieces many ſtrong Houſes, and laid great Trees on their backs, which in an inſtance were plucked up by the roots. There was not far off a Lime-kiln, on which ſome part of the tempeſt did fall with ſo great violence that all the Lime was blown up in the Air, Juſt as in a high ſtorm the waters of the Sea are blown, when the winds and the waves do wraſtle for ſupremacy. This being done, that part of the fiery tempeſt which came ſo low, was ſeen by all to take its courſe up the hill, where it vaniſhed away, and was heard here no more noyſe of it.</p>
            <p>It is certified by ſeveral letters, that this Tempeſt at the firſt did appear like a thick and rowling Smoak, and ſometimes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170804:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->it would caſt it ſelf into a great Circumference, like to a great wheel, or an Orbe, not eaſie to be compaſſed.</p>
            <p>The like ſtorm alſo happened in Derbyſhire, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in Darby Town, where although the Church ſtande u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on an advantage of higher ground then any other place, yet ſome part of of the Church yard and Church it ſelf, hath been cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the inſolence and uſurpation of the waters, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the Town being almoſt drowned, the Inhabitants are compelled to betake themſelves, and take their goods along with them into the upper rooms for their preſent ſafety, divers herds of Cattel have been deſtroyed by theſe inundations both there and in other parts.</p>
            <p>In Scotland alſo they have lately ſuffered very much and in very many places by the late glut of rain, and immoderate wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Clouds, which hath ſwelled the waters to ſo great a highth that about Leith the Mills are drowned, and three thouſand pounds will nor make good the loſſe, or repair the outrages, which the violence of the inundations have commited there.</p>
            <p>By theſe and other great Flouds in divers parts, whereby both harveſt, and Cattel have been carried away at once, all the hopes of the lamenting husbandman is loſt.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> witneſſeth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> after they were dead many hundred years before Chriſt, yet they appeared bodily and ghoſtly in Mount Tabor to Chriſt, where they ſpake and communion together.</p>
            <p>The ſoul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> did not only appear, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, but he came again both ſoul and body in token of our riſing again. But as the appearing of thoſe ſights at Gods appointment were moſt true, ſo it is moſt abſurd to give credit that the ſouls of men after death do either by viſions or by bodily appearance ſhew themſelves: but the Devil is well beaten in experience of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170804:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->things, and knoweth beſt how he may deceive the wiſeſt, for he is ſubtile and crafty. If the Marriner doth know when ſtorm and tempeſts ariſe, if the Phyſitian judgeth by the Urine the ſtate and danger of the Patient, if the skilful Aſtronomer can many years before exactly fortel the Eclipſe of the Sun and Moon, in fine, if the ſouldier knoweth where the victory will happen, no marvel it is that the Devil an old Souldier, can foreſhew things to come, and make things apparent of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Thus have ſeveral miraculous appearances been in all ages, which have produced ſtrange alterations, but the event of theſe time will make manifeſt.</p>
